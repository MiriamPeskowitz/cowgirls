They defend the things they hold dear. A cowgirl might be a rancher, or a barrel racer, or a bull rider, or an actress.

/*
Notes and ideas:
add more quotes: up to 25 and more colors 
content.html(randomQuote);
content.attr({
"class": "cowgirl-quote"

click can also be: mouseenter, hover


console.log(quotes.length);

var content = $("<p>");


get a random number, return it, dynamically make a div with ht and width' 

need to remove the old quote use empty()

setTimeOut()

append,html,attr
